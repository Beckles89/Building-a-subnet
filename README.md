## üîß Project Overview: Creating a Subnet in VirtualBox

This project demonstrates how to **create and configure a subnet** using **VirtualBox** and **virtual machines (VMs)**. It walks through setting up internal networking, assigning static IPs, testing connectivity, and understanding basic network segmentation.

# üß© Creating a Subnet in VirtualBox with VMs

## üìå Project Goal

To simulate a subnet in a virtualized environment using VirtualBox and multiple VMs (Ubuntu, Kali Linux, or Windows), and understand how subnetting works in real-world network segmentation.

---

## üõ† Requirements

* Oracle VirtualBox (latest version)
* At least 2 virtual machines (preferably Ubuntu/Kali)
* Basic networking knowledge (IP addressing, subnetting)

---

## üåê Steps to Create a Subnet in VirtualBox

### 1. Create VMs

* Launch VirtualBox and create 2+ VMs (Linux or Windows).
* Use the same operating system for simplicity (e.g., Ubuntu Desktop).

### 2. Configure Network Settings

* Go to each VM‚Äôs **Settings > Network** tab.
* **Adapter 1**:

  * Attach to: `Internal Network`
  * Name: `SubnetLab`

> This ensures all selected VMs share a private LAN-like network.

### 3. Boot the VMs

* Start each VM and log in.

### 4. Assign Static IP Addresses

#### Example for Ubuntu VM:

Edit `/etc/netplan/01-netcfg.yaml` (may vary based on your Linux distro):

```yaml
network:
  version: 2
  ethernets:
    enp0s3:
      addresses: [192.168.10.10/24]
      gateway4: 192.168.10.1
      nameservers:
        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]
```

Run:

```bash
sudo netplan apply
```

Repeat with different IPs for each VM (e.g., 192.168.10.11, 192.168.10.12).

### 5. Test Connectivity

* Use the `ping` command to verify subnet communication:

```bash
ping 192.168.10.11
```

* All VMs should be able to ping each other if the subnet is correctly configured.
